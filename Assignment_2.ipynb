        "Connect four is a connection game in which two players take turns dropping discs into a (6 x 7) board, i.e., 6 rows x 7 columns. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.\n",

The move will be ignored at the same player will be prompted again. If player X has won the game by being the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of his/her own discs, the game will output Player X has won!. If player O has won the game by being the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of his/her own discs, the game will output Player O has won!. If there is draw, i.e., no players can place any discs any more because the board is full, the game will output Draw!.\n",
